# Nbody Simulation using Barnes Hut Quad Tree Approach
A Barnes Hut Galaxy Simulator using Quad Trees to simulate large bodies such as constellations, planets and particles efficiently.
Generates a comparative window of comparing the Brute Force Approach *(Algorithmic Complexity: O(n^2)*) and the Barnes Hut Approach *(Algorithmic Complexity: O(n log n)*
This was done as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms Project using JavaFX
